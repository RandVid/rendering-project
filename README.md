# Rendering Project

A C++ rendering project featuring ray marching, camera controls, CSG operations, and shader/texture integration.  
Designed as a learning and experimentation project for graphics programming and real-time rendering techniques.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository implements a renderer based on **ray marching** and implicit geometry, with support for advanced visual effects and procedural content generation.

The project focuses on building a strong foundation in **3D math**, **rendering algorithms**, and **shader-based effects**, while remaining modular and extensible.
